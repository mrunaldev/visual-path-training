# Day 31: Advanced Concurrency Patterns

This module covers advanced concurrency patterns in Go, demonstrating real-world applications of Go's concurrency primitives.

## Topics Covered

1. Worker Pool Pattern
   - Pool management
   - Job distribution
   - Result collection
   - Graceful shutdown

2. Pipeline Pattern
   - Stage composition
   - Data flow
   - Error handling
   - Cancellation

3. Fan-out Fan-in Pattern
   - Work distribution
   - Result aggregation
   - Load balancing
   - Resource management

## Examples

1. `advanced_concurrency.go`
   - Basic implementation of patterns
   - Simple examples
   - Pattern comparison

2. `worker_pool.go`
   - Advanced worker pool implementation
   - Context-based cancellation
   - Result handling
   - Error management

## Key Components

1. Worker Pool
   ```go
   type Worker struct {
       ID     int
       Jobs   <-chan int
       Output chan<- Result
       Done   <-chan struct{}
   }
   ```

2. Pipeline
   ```go
   func stage(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
       out := make(chan int)
       go func() {
           defer close(out)
           for n := range in {
               out <- process(n)
           }
       }()
       return out
   }
   ```

3. Fan-out Fan-in
   ```go
   func fanOut(input <-chan int) []<-chan int {
       // Distribute work to multiple goroutines
   }
   
   func fanIn(inputs ...<-chan int) <-chan int {
       // Merge results from multiple channels
   }
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Resource Management
   - Use buffered channels appropriately
   - Implement graceful shutdown
   - Handle timeouts

2. Error Handling
   - Propagate errors through channels
   - Use error channels
   - Implement timeouts

3. Performance
   - Balance number of workers
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Avoid goroutine leaks

## Applications

1. Network Services
   - HTTP request handling
   - WebSocket management
   - RPC processing

2. Data Processing
   - Stream processing
   - Batch operations
   - Real-time analytics

3. System Design
   - Load balancing
   - Job scheduling
   - Event processing

## Exercises

1. Rate Limited Worker Pool
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Handle backpressure
   - Monitor throughput

2. Pipeline with Error Handling
   - Add error channels
   - Implement retries
   - Handle timeouts
