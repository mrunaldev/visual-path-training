# Concurrency Fundamentals in Go
## Week 3 - Day 11

---

# Today's Topics

1. Understanding Concurrency
2. Goroutines
3. Basic Synchronization
4. Best Practices

---

# What is Concurrency?

- Executing multiple tasks simultaneously
- Different from parallelism
- Managing multiple tasks
- Improved program efficiency

---

# Goroutines

- Lightweight threads
- Managed by Go runtime
- Started with `go` keyword
- Independent execution

```go
func hello(name string) {
    fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!\n", name)
}

go hello("World")  // Run in background
```

---

# Why Use Goroutines?

- Very lightweight (a few KB)
- Quick to create and destroy
- Automatically managed
- Efficient scheduling
- Better resource utilization

---

# Basic Synchronization

```go
var wg sync.WaitGroup

wg.Add(1)  // Add counter
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()  // Decrease counter
    // Do work
}()

wg.Wait()  // Wait for completion
```

---

# Mutual Exclusion

```go
var mu sync.Mutex

mu.Lock()
// Critical section
mu.Unlock()

// Or with defer
mu.Lock()
defer mu.Unlock()
```

---

# Common Patterns

1. Worker Pools
2. Fan-out/Fan-in
3. Pipeline Processing
4. Background Tasks

---

# Best Practices

1. Don't start goroutines without control
2. Handle panics in goroutines
3. Clean up resources
4. Use appropriate synchronization
5. Avoid goroutine leaks

---

# Exercise Time!

1. Create concurrent counters
2. Implement worker pools
3. Practice synchronization
4. Handle shared resources
