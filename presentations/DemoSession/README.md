# Day 0: Introduction to Go Programming

This is a sample session to demonstrate the course structure and give students a taste of Go programming.

## Session Structure (1 hour)

1. **Introduction (15 minutes)**
   - Course overview
   - Why Go?
   - Who uses Go?
   - What we'll learn

2. **Live Demo (25 minutes)**
   - Quote of the Day program
   - Basic Go concepts demonstration
   - Interactive coding session

3. **Q&A (20 minutes)**
   - Course-related questions
   - Technical questions
   - Administrative queries

## Demo Program: Quote of the Day

The demo program (`quote_of_day.go`) demonstrates several Go concepts:

- Basic program structure
- Packages and imports
- Custom types (structs)
- Slices and arrays
- Functions
- Random number generation
- User input
- Formatted output

### Running the Demo

1. Make sure Go is installed:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```

2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   cd demos/day0
   go run quote_of_day.go
   ```

### Learning Points

1. **Program Structure**
   - Package declaration
   - Import statements
   - Main function

2. **Go Types**
   - Structs
   - Slices
   - Strings

3. **Functions**
   - Function declaration
   - Return values
   - Parameters

4. **User Interaction**
   - Console input/output
   - Formatted printing

## Next Steps

After this introduction, students will be ready to begin Week 1 of the course, where we'll dive deeper into Go fundamentals.
