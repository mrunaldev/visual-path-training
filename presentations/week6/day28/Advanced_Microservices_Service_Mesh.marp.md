# Advanced Microservices with Go: Service Mesh
## Day 28: Service Mesh Implementation and Patterns

---

# Overview

1. Service Mesh Fundamentals
2. Implementing with Istio
3. Traffic Management
4. Security Patterns
5. Observability
6. Hands-on Practice

---

# What is a Service Mesh?

- Infrastructure layer for microservices communication
- Handles:
  - Service Discovery
  - Load Balancing
  - Traffic Management
  - Security
  - Observability

---

# Key Components

1. Control Plane
   - Configuration
   - Policy Management
   - Service Discovery

2. Data Plane
   - Proxies (Sidecars)
   - Traffic Routing
   - Health Checks

---

# Istio with Go Services

```go
// Service Configuration
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: my-go-service
spec:
  hosts:
  - my-go-service
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: my-go-service
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: my-go-service
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```

---

# Traffic Management

1. Request Routing
2. Load Balancing
3. Traffic Splitting
4. Circuit Breaking
5. Fault Injection

---

# Service Mesh Security

1. mTLS Communication
2. Authorization Policies
3. Certificate Management
4. Identity Verification

---

# Implementing Circuit Breaking

```go
// Circuit Breaker Configuration
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: my-go-service
spec:
  host: my-go-service
  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection:
      consecutiveErrors: 5
      interval: 30s
      baseEjectionTime: 30s
```

---

# Observability

1. Metrics
   - Request Count
   - Latency
   - Error Rates

2. Tracing
   - Request Flow
   - Bottleneck Detection

3. Logging
   - Structured Logs
   - Correlation IDs

---

# Best Practices

1. Progressive Delivery
2. Fine-grained Traffic Control
3. Security-first Approach
4. Comprehensive Monitoring
5. Performance Optimization

---

# Hands-on Exercise

1. Deploy Go microservices with Istio
2. Configure traffic routing
3. Implement circuit breakers
4. Set up monitoring
5. Test resilience patterns

---

# Key Takeaways
